# CS576-Tetris-Sample

1. Clone this repo
2. Open it in a 2021 version of Unity
3. 2xClick TetrisScene (in Assets/Scenes)
4. Hit run?

Apologies for the mess. YMMV.

Updated README with working engine

Game adapts to skilled players by:
	1) At levels 3+, spawning more than one random angry block each time a row is completed
	2) At levels 4+, a random angry block is spawned each time a new block is dropped, not just on completion of a row
